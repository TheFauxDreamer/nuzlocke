# Pokémon Nuzlocke Tracker
A web-based nuzlocke tracking website! Supports generations 1-7.

Starting a nuzlocke? Trying to work out how on earth you'll keep track of the routes, Pokémon, if they've fainted, what gym you're up to, the current level cap, and what the optimal team is?

You're in the right place!

This is based on my previous Soul Link website, for more about that go here: https://github.com/TheFauxDreamer/SoulLink

## What it does

- **Duplicate protection** - won't let you catch duplicate types or evolution families  
- **Gym progress tracking** - knows every gym leader and shows your current level cap
- **Team suggestions** - not sure if you can have a full team of 6? We can check in a click
- **Generation validation** - only shows Pokémon that exist in your chosen game
- **Streamer mode** - clean overlay window for streaming your run
- **Import/export** - save your progress as a file to backup or share

## How it works

Pick your generation & game, add Pokémon as you catch them, and it handles the rest. Pokemon that can't be added due to team composition rules aren't available. Faiting a pokemon will remove them automatically from the team.

Works with every major Pokémon game from Red/Blue through Ultra Sun/Moon, with all the routes and gym leaders you'd expect.

This is in development and being worked on in my free time. There is no server, so your teams are saved to browser, but you can export (recommended after each session) for safe keeping or to transfer between PCs!
